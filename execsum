Executive Summary: Comparing SharePoint Communities and SharePoint Intranet
This executive summary highlights the key differences between SharePoint Community Sites and SharePoint Intranet Sites to drive executive decision-making towards adopting SharePoint as the primary intranet solution.

Focus and Purpose
SharePoint Community Sites are designed to enhance user engagement and interactions. They function as social hubs where employees can engage in discussions, share expertise, and crowdsource solutions to common problems.
SharePoint Intranet Sites prioritize operational efficiency and corporate communications. They offer a controlled environment for disseminating news, updates, procedures, and processes, ensuring content is centrally managed.
Technical Limitations and Migration Challenges
Viva Engage Platform: Available only in SharePoint Communities, poses migration challenges due to its data structure involving comments, social interactions, and permissions. This platform is not compatible with SharePoint Intranet.
Future Migration Considerations: Migration to another SharePoint platform will incur additional costs and require licenses such as Sharegate. Migration from existing platforms (Websphere Portal and TeamSite) to SharePoint Intranet is within the scope of current initiatives.
Cross-Site Publishing and Targeting: Community sites typically limit content sharing within the community, whereas Intranet sites can securely publish and target content across multiple departments, ensuring a single source of accurate information.
Search Availability: Community sites have limited search capabilities confined to within the community, focusing on social search. Intranet sites employ a robust enterprise search engine, capable of indexing and searching across the Intranet with security-trimmed content.
Administrative Control and Content Dynamics
Administrative Control: Community sites have a fragmented approach to digital workspace management, potentially causing confusion. In contrast, Intranet sites provide a unified platform for consistent branding, user experience, and administrative control.
Content Dynamics: Community content is user-generated and evolves with ongoing discussions, Q&A, advice, and sharing best practices. Intranet content is more static, curated by content managers or administrators, and includes formal communications like policies, procedures, company news, and training materials.
Management and Governance
Community Sites: Require active moderation to ensure discussions remain productive and on-topic, and need policies for engagement and content sharing to maintain a respectful environment. There are no controls for language and translation requirements.
Intranet Sites: Require stringent content management strategies and governance to ensure information is accurate, up-to-date, and aligns with organizational objectives and compliance requirements.
Recommendation
Given the structured environment, robust search capabilities, consistent administrative control, and centralized content management, SharePoint Intranet Sites are recommended as the primary intranet solution. They ensure operational efficiency, secure communication, and reliable dissemination of corporate information, making them an ideal choice for executive decision-making.

By migrating to SharePoint Intranet, organizations can achieve better governance, enhanced productivity, and a unified digital workspace that aligns with business goals and compliance needs.
